description: Getting started on our final papers
---
Welcome to December! In the remainder of our classes, we’re going to be workshopping ideas, drafts and our final essays. This week, the classes will be **compulsory**, but from next week, I will ask you to either attend, or to add a progress report to canvas to get your attendance grade. I’ll be in class to offer advice and support. If you want to make use of this, turn up at the beginning of class. If, after 30 minutes, nobody is there, I’ll leave the class!

There’s a lot of work to be done on these essays. But you have a lot of class time to do this work. Together we have six sessions of one hour and 40 minutes each. That makes **10 hours**.

This is a generous allowance of time to take the pressure off you, and to make this final sprint to the end as easy as possible. But you **_must_** use this time to write your essays. If you don’t, and you leave everything to the last minute, then the responsibility is entirely yours. I will only take extensions in exceptional circumstances. Otherwise, I will drop 4% per day that your essay is late, up to 5 days. After that, I will accept no more late assignments, and you will fail.

We'll get into breakout groups and discuss your feedback. Then we'll get started writing!
