## Welcome back

Welcome to December! In the remainder of our classes, we're going to be workshopping ideas, drafts and our final essays. This week, the classes will be **compulsory**, but from next week, I will ask you to either attend, or to add a progress report to canvas to get your attendance grade. I'll be in class to offer advice and support. If you want to make use of this, turn up at the beginning of class. If, after 30 minutes, nobody is there, I'll leave the class!

There's a lot of work to be done on these essays. But you have a lot of class time to do this work. Together we have six sessions of one hour and 40 minutes each. That makes **10 hours**.

This is a generous allowance of time to take the pressure off you, and to make this final sprint to the end as easy as possible. But you **_must_** use this time to write your essays. If you don't, and you leave everything to the last minute, then the responsibility is entirely yours. I will only take extensions in exceptional circumstances. Otherwise, I will drop 4% per day that your essay is late, up to 4 days. After that, I will accept no more late assignments, and you will fail.

## Checking in

Let's check in first. I've given you feedback on your submissions. So we'll take 10 minutes. I want you to use this time to discuss the feedback.

## Questions

Any questions on your feedback?

## Next steps

In groups, discuss the following:

1.  What do I need to think about to move forward on this essay?
    
2.  What questions do I need to resolve?
    
3.  What do I need to read?
    
4.  What do I need to research?
    

## Questions

Again, there's time for questions. After that, we can have a chance either to consult with me, to go and work on your own, or to join a "shut up and write" group.
