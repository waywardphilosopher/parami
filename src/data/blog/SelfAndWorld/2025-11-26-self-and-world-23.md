## **Checking In**

This time, we're moving on to looking at the final assignment.

## **Assignment Briefing**

Let's look at the assignment briefing on Canvas. This briefing is deliberately wide. You can interpret it in many ways. What I want to see is a diversity of submissions, pieces of writing that really reflect who you are and what you want to say. As we said earlier on, creative nonfiction is a broad genre. So you are free to write what you like.

## **Quick-fire writing exercises.**

Think about the writing you have done on this course. Now answer these questions. I’ll ask one question every two or three minutes.

NaN.  What reading did you love the most? Why?
    
NaN.  What reading did you hate the most? Why?
    
NaN.  What are the three pieces of advice that most stick in your mind? Write them down! Why do they stick in your mind?
    
NaN.  Which writing exercise did you find most fun? Why?
    
NaN.  Which writing exercise did you find least fun? Why?
    
NaN.  What has your writing on this course taught you about yourself?
    
NaN.  What piece of your writing are you most proud of? Why?
    
NaN.  What piece of your writing makes you think, "I have more to say about this topic?"
    
NaN.  Now you are close to the end of this course, who are you as a writer?
    
NaN.  What do you want to write next?
    

After this, I’ll put you into breakout groups to reflect on the course.
