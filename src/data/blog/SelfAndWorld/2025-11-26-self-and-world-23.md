## **Checking In**

This time, we're moving on to looking at the final assignment.

## **Discussion**

In groups, discuss the following:

*   What reading from this course (or what reading that you did for this course, even if not assigned) spoke to you the most? Why?
    
*   What piece of writing are you most proud of? It may be an assignment, but it may be something else — just a short piece your wrote for the discussion board, for example.
    
*   What do you most want to write about, now you are coming to the end of the course?
    
*   What burning questions do you have at this point in the course?
