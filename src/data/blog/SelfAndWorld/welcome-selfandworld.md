## Welcome to Writing Self and World

Welcome to Writing Self and World. In this course, we're going to be exploring creative nonfiction writing: we're going to be telling true stories, and doing so with as much creativity, imagination and skill as we can muster!


I'm just setting up the website at the moment. But this will be the place for ongoing course notes from the classes. For every class, I will upload my own class notes for you to read. This will be useful for you to catch up if you miss a class (we'll talk about attendance in our first class). I'll also upload any extra links and snippets that may be interesting and fun. So this website is a living document!


## About this site 

I've designed the website to be very, very lightweight. This means that it uses a minimal amount of data, and so whatever your device, it should load easily and efficiently. 

What isn't on this site:

- Cool interactive features
- Fancy graphics and animations
- Videos (though I may share links)
- Things you have to log in to access

What is on this site:

- Lots of words! It's text all the way!
- Useful information.
- My class notes, updated after every class
- Interesting ideas.
- Links to interesting places.
- Nice formatting, to make it easy to read.
