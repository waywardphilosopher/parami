description: Thinking about the Market

## **Welcome Back**

In this session, we’re going to start thinking about the creative nonfiction market. As a creative nonfiction writer, there are literally thousands of places that you can publish in. The challenge isn’t the _lack_ of places, it is finding the _right_ place. And individual writers will over time build up a set of connections with places where they feel their work is welcomed.

So today is going to be largely exploratory. You are going to do some research, and share this with the rest of the group. We’re going to look at commercial markets for nonfiction writing, and I’m going to assume that you want to be **paid** for your hard work.

## **Pitching vs. Sending Final Pieces**

For much nonfiction, you will not be writing something and then sending the finished piece out into the world. You will be pitching your work. We’ll talk much more about pitching next time. But a pitch is effectively a short communication that you send to an editor (usually as an email), telling them who you are, and offering to write a piece for their publication. If the editor says, "Hey, this writer, and their proposal sound great," they will sign a contract with you, and you can start writing.

Pitching is great, because it saves time — you don’t have to write 10,000 words and find nobody wants it. This makes it a good way of efficiently match-making between writers and publishers.

Some more literary magazines and journals may ask for full manuscripts. But for many outlets, and all journalistic outlets, you will pitch first.

## **Initial research**

To find places to submit, you need to think about what you like to read. Then you need to research how to submit to them.

1.  Do a web search for "call for submissions" AND nonfiction. This will give you some leads.
    
2.  This will give you two kinds of resources: lists of open submissions, and also individual websites.
    
3.  Click through to any links you like the look of.
    
4.  Follow the thread to find the publication websites, and see what kind of things they publish.
    
5.  If you are interested in a publication, see if they have any submissions guidelines (these may be called "Write for Us", or "Submissions Guidelines" or "Pitch to Us"). Read through their guidelines.
    

By the end of the 30 minutes, try and find **two publications that you might one day want to pitch to**.

## **Thinking about pitching**

We’ve now had a chance to think about the market, so we’re going to explore the art of pitching. So let’s launch in.

A **pitch** is a proposal for a story you want to tell, one that you share with editors or publishers to see if they want to publish your work. Writing a pitch can be a great way of shaping your ideas. So we're going to be working in this session in writing a pitch for a story. The aim of a pitch is to give a clear idea of what a story is, and what you need to do to write it.

A good pitch needs to be

*   clear
    
*   concise
    
*   detailed
    
*   well-written
    
*   compelling
    

Remember that as a creative nonfiction writer, you are a **storyteller**. One common complaint amongst editors is that people pitch _ideas_ to them when in fact what they are looking for are _stories._ So the strongest pitches will be those that set out to tell a story. You can think of your pitch as being made up of three mini-stories, each one a paragraph long.

*   In the first paragraph, summarise the story that your piece will be telling, and tell us why this story matters and needs to be heard here and now.
    
*   In the second paragraph, tell the story of how you will write the piece. How long will it be? How will you research it? What information will you draw on? Books? Interviews? Your own experience?
    
*   In the final paragraph, tell the story of **you**: who you are,,your experience and interests, and why you are the person to write this piece.
    

Let's look an example, from a recent successful pitch of my own:

> **_Pitch: The Rise of Tâi-gí_**

\[OPENING PARAGRAPH\] I would love to write a piece for you on the Taiwanese language, or Tâi-gí, a dialect of Hokkien that is the second most-spoken language in Taiwan. Until the mid-20th century, Tâi-gí was the most widely spoken language in Taiwan. But under Taiwan's almost four decades of martial law, Tâi-gí was suppressed in favour of Mandarin. As a result of these decades of suppression, many young people now struggle to speak the language of their grandparents' generation. But more recently, Tâi-gí has seen a renewed popularity, and has been undergoing a revival. This revival is tied up with a growing sense that linguistic and cultural diversity is a cornerstone of Taiwan's history, and of its distinctive and emerging identity.

\[WHAT I’LL WRITE\] In this piece, I will dive into the history and politics of language in Taiwan. I will explore how Taiwan's linguistic diversity went into decline, and how it is being revived. And I will ask what the revival of Tâi-gí says about Taiwan's growing self-confidence as a multilingual and multicultural democracy. I will frame this story with the story of my own attempts to get to grips with Tâi-gí — a language made difficult by having no single standardised writing system, multiple local dialects, and a constantly shifting tonal system that makes Mandarin seem like a piece of cake.

\[HOW I’LL RESEARCH\] For on-the-ground research, I will speak to language teachers and advocates, poets, writers, and scholars. I will catch up with YouTuber Ayo, a leading figure in the Tâi-gí revival. I will speak to Dr. Poe-iong Lin, a researcher of Tâi-gí literature at the National Museum of Taiwan Literature. And I will speak to those running innovative projects, including the owners of Gutta Books&Coffee in Tamsui, Taipei, a bookstore that every Monday — to the astonishment of many local Taiwanese people, as well as that of foreign visitors — becomes a Tâi-gí Language Only zone.

\[WHAT THE READER WILL GET OUT OF THE STORY\] My aim in this piece is to explore how this struggle to support Taiwan's linguistic diversity, in a time of ongoing cross-strait tensions, is helping to forge a new identity for Taiwan as a place where many stories are told in many languages.

\[ABOUT ME\] I’m a writer from the UK, currently based in Taiwan. My previous book, Hello, Stranger: Stories of Connection in a Divided World, was published by Granta in 2022. I've touched on the Taiwanese revival in other places (see this recent piece for the BBC: [https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20240710-tainan-the-400-year-old-cradle-of-taiwanese-culture](https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20240710-tainan-the-400-year-old-cradle-of-taiwanese-culture)), but I would love the opportunity to give the Tâi-gí revival movement the treatment it deserves.

## **Reading Pitches**

Because pitching is a specific _genre_ of writing, you can best get a sense of how to pitch by reading the pitches of others. So have a look at the following link, find an article that interests you, and see how the author pitches it:

[Open notebook](https://www.theopennotebook.com/pitches/)

I’ll then put you in groups to discuss the pitch, and why you think it was successful.

## **Writing your Own Pitch**

Now we're going to move onto writing your own pitch. For this exercise, I want you to think about pitching as storytelling. You are telling at least three stories.

*   Story 1 (The story I want to tell in the article)
    
*   Story 2 (The story of how I will tell it)
    
*   Story 3 (The story of who I am, and why I am the person to tell this story)
    

This will almost always be an email communication. So think about getting the right tone. And this may also depend on the publication. An editor may get 100s of pitches every week. So you need to be concise. Think of writing **one short paragraph** for each of these stories.

## **Homework: Market Research**

For your homework, find **three** publications that you might want to pitch. And for each, post to the discussion board:

*   The name of the publication
    
*   A weblink to the publication
    
*   An idea (just a sentence or two) about a **story** that you might want to pitch there.
