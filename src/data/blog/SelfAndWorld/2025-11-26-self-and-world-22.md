description: Thinking like an editor
---
## Welcome

Welcome to today's session. Today you're going to be thinking like an editor. You'll be pairing up with another writer, and casting an editorial eye on their work.

I'll put you in breakout groups of two to give you a randomly allocated partner. Read your partner's pitch on canvas and note down the publication your partner is pitching. Now do the following:

1.  Re-read the pitch guidelines for this publication.
    
2.  Read at least three articles from this publication.
    
3.  Write down at least three words that represent the _editorial style_ of this publication.
    

When you have done this, your task is to write an editorial report for your partner. In this report, write down:

1.  How closely did the writer follow the pitch guidelines?
    
2.  How suitable you think the pitch is for the publication? Will you accept it, reject it, or propose some changes?
    
3.  Was there anything about the pitch that you didn’t understand or couldn’t make sense of?
    
4.  What advice do you have for the writer to strengthen their pitch?
    

Post your feedback for the other writer on Canvas. Then pair up and talk through.
