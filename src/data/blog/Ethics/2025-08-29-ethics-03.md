## Welcome

Welcome to this class. We're going to talk first about the idea of unbreakable ethical rules. Are there any ethical rules (for example, “eating people is wrong”) that we should _always_ and _everywhere_ adhere to? When we have talked about this, we'll move on to talking about Kant in more depth.

Write for five minutes in response to this question: **Are there any ethical rules that we should _always_ and _everywhere_ adhere to?** What are these rules, and why should we adhere to them?

Then I'll put you in pairs to share what you have written. When your partner has shared what they have written, your job is to find **at least one situation where you think your partner's rule _shouldn't_ be followed.**

We'll talk about this for the rest of the session.
