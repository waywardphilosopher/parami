## Welcome back

Today, we are going to talk about a new approach to ethics, and that is _care ethics_. This is a growing field that attempts to rethink ethics not in terms of principles, rules, duties, or virtues, but instead in terms of the care that takes place within relationships. Care ethics takes as its foundation the practice, or the experience, of responding to the needs of another. It sees the root of ethics as being a responsiveness to the needs of others with whom we are in relationship.

## Our experience of care

Think of a specific time when someone acted in a way to truly cared for you—in a meaningful way. What did they do, and how did it make you feel? Write for 5 minutes.

Now, in breakout groups, discuss this experience of care.

*   What quality made this act feel like genuine care?
    
*   What were the effects of this care (on both you, and on the other person)?
    
*   Did it involve following a rule, or was it something more responsive to your situation?
    

## An Introduction to Care Ethics

Care ethics has its roots in a specifically _feminist_ approach to ethics. Let's watch Carol Gilligan, one of the most significant figures in care ethics, introducing the topic:

Let's look at some questions:

*   What did you most agree with in the video? What did you most disagree with?
    
*   In your experience, do men and women think about ethics differently?
    
*   Are our theories of ethics limited if they only include women's voices?
    
*   In your society, is "caring about relationships" gendered?
    
*   Do we have different moral expectations on men and women?
    

## Care in society

*   Is more care always a good thing? Why (or why not)?
    
*   What are the conditions that help produce a more caring environment? What conditions prevent the creation of a more caring environment?
