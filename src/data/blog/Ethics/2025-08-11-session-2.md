## Welcome back!

Welcome back to your second class. In this class, we are going to reflect on the work you have done for your homework.

## Discussion

We'll start off in groups, talking about your homework. I want you to discuss the following two questions:

1.  What was the ethical problem that you faced?
    
2.  How did you resolve this problem? How did you come to a decision?
    

We'll feed back afterwards.

## Can we Reach Objectivity in Ethics?

Last time, we talked about the passage from the Euthyphro, where Plato reminds us that objectivity in ethics is difficult — when compared to things we can more readily measure.

In this course, we're going to explore some answers to the question: how can I know what is ethical, good, or right?

One way is by thinking about **rules**. Are there some ethical rules that can never be broken?
