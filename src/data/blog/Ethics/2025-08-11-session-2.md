## Welcome back!

Welcome back to your second class. In this class, we are going to reflect on the work you have done for your homework.

## Discussion

We'll start off in groups, talking about your homework. I want you to discuss the following two questions:

1.  What was the ethical problem that you faced?
    
2.  How did you resolve this problem? How did you come to a decision?
    

We'll feed back afterwards.

## Can we Reach Objectivity in Ethics?

Last time, we talked about the passage from the Euthyphro, where Plato reminds us that objectivity in ethics is difficult — when compared to things we can more readily measure.

In this course, we're going to explore some answers to the question: how can I know what is ethical, good, or right?

*   One way is by thinking about **rules and principles**. Are there some ethical rules that can never be broken? This is often called _deontological ethics_.
    
*   Another way is by thinking about **consequences** and **outcomes**. If you read about _consequentialism_ or _utilitarianism_, these approaches to ethics fall under this broad category.
    
*   Or you could think about the ethical **qualities and virtues** that make us good. What makes Gatsby the dog a good boy? Loyalty? Not barking at strangers? Or some other virtues? And how do we—and Gatsby—cultivate virtues? This is called _virtue ethics_, and is strongly associated with the Greek thinker Aristotle. Some argue that Buddhist ethics, or Confucian ethics, are forms of virtue ethics.
    
*   Or perhaps, ethics is about **caring** for others. How do we build a culture of care? Should we care for each other equally, or should care be differentiated according to our different relationships?
