---
Welcome to our first class in this course on philosophical ethics. We're going to be exploring ethical theories, and trying to think through ethical issues more systematically and consistently. We'll also be seeing how these theories play out in practice.

But first, we need to do some introductions. If we've not met before, I'm Will Buckingham, and I'm leading the course this semester. If you want to find out more about me, you can have a look at my [website](https://www.willbuckingham.com).

## Introductions

We'll start with introductions. We can take our time with this, to get to know each other.

*   What is your name? Please tell us your preferred name, and your full name. If you could also type it in the chat, that would be helpful.
    
*   What pronouns do you prefer?
    
*   Where do you live?
    
*   Tell us one ethically (slightly) bad thing you like to do.
    
*   Tell us one ethically good thing you like to do.
    

## About the Course

There is a syllabus provided on Canvas in handy reference format under the "syllabus" tab. But **this may go out of date**. We may change direction as we go along if things get interesting! The beauty of seminar classes is that they are really flexible.

We'll be talking about a number of things in this session:

*   The aims and the shape of the course
    
*   The readings
    
*   How we will work together
    
*   Attendance, participation and academic integrity
    
*   Grading
    
*   Office hours
    
*   Extra resources
    
*   Language policies
    

## Questions

We will discuss any questions in the session, but if you have any other questions, email me on [will.buckingham@parami.edu.mm](mailto:will.buckingham@parami.edu.mm)!

## About Ethics

What is ethics? As a philosophical discipline, ethics is about thinking through — and putting into practice — ideas about what is good and bad. Ethics is also sometimes referred to as "moral philosophy." Some people like to make a distinction between "ethics" and "morals", but there is no single agreed distinction. "Ethics" comes from the Greek language, while "morality" comes from Latin. In this course, we are going to be relaxed about this terminology. But I lean towards using the language of "ethics" rather than "morals" because to my ear, it sounds a bit richer in content, and perhaps a little less judgemental.

We're not going to define ethics at the start of this course. Fixed definitions may not be useful to us in exploring the range of different ways human beings have gone about reflecting on goodness and badness. Instead, as we go on, we'll see the various ways that the language of ethics (or morality) is used. For the time being, the following are the kinds of questions that have an ethical dimension:

*   Can I sometimes lie, if it helps realise a higher aim—or prevents a serious harm?
    
*   What makes a person good?
    
*   What duties do I have to others? To myself? To the truth?
    
*   Is it okay to steal
