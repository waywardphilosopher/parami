This is an asynchronous class. So you'll not be attending in person, but you need to do the work, and—to get your participation and attendance grades—respond to the questions on Canvas. You should already have read Virginia held's piece on the ethics of care.

## A: Virginia Held on the Ethics of Care

Watch the following video, and make notes. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0XcQgXn-yM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0XcQgXn-yM)

## B: The Ethics of Care as Moral Theory

Go back to the text, and try to answer the question: **what, according to Virginia Held, are the major features of the ethics of care**?

## C: Can Care Transform Us?

Answer the following two questions, drawing on Held's text, the video, and your own thoughts.

1.  What are the main ways in which **_care happens_** within your own societies and social contexts?
    
2.  Do you think that a greater emphasis on care could transform these societies and social contexts? If so, how?
