## Welcome back

Welcome back to the session. Today, we're going to be continuing our work on care ethics.

The reading was from Virginia Held, and was about how care ethics functions as a _moral theory_. First, we're going to get clear on the argument of the chapter yo uhave read. In your groups:

1.  **_Identify_** what you think are the **most important sections** of the reading.
    
2.  **_Summarise in your own words_** what the author is saying in these sections.
    
3.  **_Explain_** why these sections are important to the author’s argument.
    
4.  **_Give a practical example_** that can help us understand the argument.
    

## Care at Parami

In the second half, we're going to look at this in practice. In breakout groups, discuss the following:

*   To what extent do you think that Parami is built around an ethics of care?
    
*   What concrete changes could be made to embed an ethics of care more deeply into Parami's work?
    
*   Would extending the reach of an ethics of care be beneficial for Parami, or would it lead to problems (for example, bias, conflicts of interest etc.)? If the latter, how could these problems be mitigated.
    

## Homework

For your homework, read Toward an African Moral Theory, and post your reflections on Canvas discussion board.
