description: Keeping field notes
---
Two days ago, I was at Sun Yat-sen University in Kaohsiung with a group of students from Parami and from here in Taiwan, running a workshop on field notes. It was one of those rare occasions when we get the chance to meet face-to-face, and so felt like a really precious opportunity.

We talked about a lot of things. But the main thing was this: take notes! If you don't take notes, you will forget. Even if something feels important at the time, you will forget. Making notes either _in situ_, or else at the end of a long day of research and reading, is a way of capturing your thoughts and ideas, a way of consolidating your knowledge, and a way of recording both what is happening objectively, and your own subjective responses. Once you start building a rich body of field notes, these can be put to work in later writing and research.

One thing we didn't get a chance to talk about was the best way of storing these notes. I do keep notebooks, but I rarely look back at older notebooks. For more stable (and searchable) notes, I use plain text (in Markdown format, which is what this site uses), and keep my notes bundled up in an Obsidian vault, which means that I can make connections between the notes, and keep track of them.

But it's important to find your own way. Here are a few things to think about if you are coming up with a system of your own:

*   How important is it to you that your notes are searchable?
    
*   Are the notes going to be in a format that you can access in 1 year's time, or 5, or 10, or 25 years' time?
    
*   Are your notes secure? Some free apps may use your data to target advertising, for example. And there are also legal responsibilities to keep research notes about identifiable individuals secure.
    
*   Does your note-keeping system encourage you to write notes, or does it get in the way? Some fancy methods may seem cool at first, but are just too complex for everyday use.
    
*   Are your notes stored in multiple places? Are they safe from fire, flood, forgetfulness and other natural disasters? When I did fieldwork in the 1990s in Indonesia, I wrote in notebooks, but used \[carbon paper\]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon\_paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_paper)) to make back-up copies that I then mailed home to the UK.
