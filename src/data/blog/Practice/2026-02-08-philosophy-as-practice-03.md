# Welcome

Welcome back. Today, we're moving on to talk about the essay from Foucault on technologies of the self. But first, we're going to start with a philosophical writing practice (we'd been planning to do this last time, but we ran out of time).

We’ll start with a six-minute writing exercise, focussing on introspection.

*   How does my body feel today?
    
*   How do I feel emotionally?
    
*   What am I thinking about, or preoccupied about?
    
*   What, just now, do I want most?
    

Then we'll go into breakout groups to say hello and check in.

## Foucault and Technologies of the Self

We've got two sessions to explore this rich, complex paper. So today, we will to look at the first part of the essay, and we will explore some of the concepts. We're also going to ask about our own "technologies of the self." But first, we'll watch this short video on Foucault. It gives a bit more context to his work.

## Four Technologies

Foucault starts by talking about four different technologies, or techniques we use to understand ourselves and to manipulate / transform ourselves, our social relationships, our power relationships, and the world.

*   Production
    
*   Sign systems
    
*   Power / domination
    
*   Self
    

First of all, two questions:

1.  In what sense are these technologies?
    
2.  Take an online class (like Parami classes) as an example. How are these four technologies in play / in use in this context?
    

We'll give you ten minutes in small breakout groups, and then we'll get you to feed back!

## Care of the Self

Next, Foucault moves on to talk about _care of the self_. He claims that in ancient Greek philosophy there were two principles: _gnothi seauton_ (Know yourself!) and _epimeleisthai sauton_ (take care of yourself!). We're more familiar with the first, but both were important in Greece—according to Foucault's argument—and they are related in interesting ways. Foucault claims that self-knowledge was _subordinate_ to self-care in the ancient Greek context.

Care of the self necessarily involves _practices_ of care. But the self, for Foucault, is not just _given_. It is also constructed through these technologies and practices! (It's not like caring for a hamster, something that already exists). So particular forms of care of the self shape our selves, and our self-concepts, in particular ways.

So let's do some writing and reflection:

*   How is self-care related to self-knowledge?
    
*   What regular practices of self-care do you have, and what do you know thanks to these practices?
    
*   How do they shape your self?
    

We'll put some notes about these self-care practices on the whiteboard.

## Writing & the Care of the Self

If you recall Shusterman's paper, you will know that philosophical writing can be conceived of as a form of _practice_, or a form of care of the self. In this sense don't write just to present our results, but to explore, to investigate, to pay attention, to introspect, to reflect, to test, to weigh-up, to judge.

We're going to talk more about this next time (and in the next class we'll set you some more extended homework with a writing/reflection practice); but for today, let's look at the letter from Marcus Aurelius on p. 233. We'll read it out loud. For context, Fronto was Marcus Aurelius's former student.

> Reading of Marcus Aurelius's letter to Fronto _(see reading p. 233)_

For Foucault, this is writing as a _philosophical practice._

## Writing exercise

Imagine you are front. Send a brief note back to Marcus Aurelius in response to this letter.

## Discussion

*   In what sense is this philosophy?
    
*   Why are these apparently inconsequential details _important_ when it comes to care of the self?
    
*   Is the care of the self the care of the body, or of the soul, or both?
    

## Homework

Reread the Foucault if you need to. For your homework, write down _one new thing_ you are going to do in the next 24 hours specifically to take care of yourself (_epimeleisthai sauton_). I want you to come up with a _novel_ self-care practice, in other words, something you don't already do. Write this thing down as a single sentence ("I will turn my phone off and hang out with the cat!", or "I will send an email to a friend!", or "I will go to bed early", or "I will put my headphones on listen to some very loud music!"

Post on the discussion board before the deadline, noting down:

1.  What is this practice that you decided on? (See if you can write this in a single sentence).
    
2.  What was the experience of _explicitly_ deciding to care for yourself in this way?
    
3.  What did you learn from this experience?
