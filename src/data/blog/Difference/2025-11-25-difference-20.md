description: Gender and the post-coup environment
---
## Welcome

Welcome back. Today, we are moving on to our final paper. We are looking at the current post-coup environment in Myanmar, and we are exploring how military power in the country is inherently gendered.

## Final paper

Your final paper proposal is due at the end of the week. I'm going to give you some time today to think through and discuss how it's going. I'll put you into breakout groups to discuss, and then we'll have a chance to talk through in the main group.

## Gender in Myanmar after the coup

Reading in class: [https://www.boell.de/en/2025/09/15/between-power-and-oppression-masculinity-myanmar-trap](https://www.boell.de/en/2025/09/15/between-power-and-oppression-masculinity-myanmar-trap)

*   In your experience, how is the coup and post-coup context in Myanmar _gendered_?
    
*   In what sense is masculinity in Myanmar "both the weapon and the wound"?
    
*   In what sense is the revolution "not only fighting against an oppressive junta but also against violent ideas of masculinity"?
