description: More on Stuart Hall
---
## Welcome back!

Welcome back. This week, we're looking at part two of Stuart Hall's essay, "Race: the Floating Signifier." As a reminder, the link to the video is here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PodKki9g2Pw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PodKki9g2Pw)

We'll watch from the middle until the end.

## Three Positions: realist, textual and discursive

In this second part of the lecture, Hall sets out three positions we can take in relation to race:

1.  Realist
2.  Textual
3.  Discursive
    

In your breakout groups, I want you to return to the text ([https://ereader.perlego.com/1/book/2397448/373](https://ereader.perlego.com/1/book/2397448/373)) and to do the following:

*   Discuss in groups to establish a clear definition of these three positions: the realist, the textual and the discursive.
*   What does the view of race as _discursive_ suggest about the history of race science
*   What is Hall arguing (and what is he _not_) arguing about the cultural functions of science?
*   What is Hall saying when he argues that the body is a "text" 
*   What do you think Hall means by conducting politics "without a guarantee"?
    

## Homework

Now we're going to move on to our final text, and that is _Orientalism_ by Edward Said. It's quite a difficult text, but it's also an important and worthwhile one. The reading is on Canvas. As usual, upload your response and one question to the discussion board to get your participation grades.
