description: Thinking through (and maybe making) Gender Trouble
---
## Welcome back

Today, we're exploring Butler in more depth. Some of you may have loved the text. Some may have had trouble with it. So we're going to think more about this trouble.

## Writing exercise

Write for 5 minutes. The title of your piece is _The Trouble with Gender_

## Being in and Making Trouble

Let's discuss the following:

1.  What did you find troubling about Butler's text?
    
2.  What do you find troubling about either the notion of gender, or how gender is imagined / reimagined within your own cultural context?
    
3.  In her 1990 preface to her book, Butler writes, "I concluded that trouble is inevitable and the task, how best to make it, what best way to be in it." What do you think she means?
    
4.  What is the best way of making this trouble? What is the best way of being in it?
    

## Close Reading

Finally, we're going to do a _close reading_ of Chapter 1 to get the argument clear. In your groups:

1.  **_Identify_** what you think are the **most important sections** of the reading.
    
2.  **_Summarise in your own words_** what the author is saying in these sections.
    
3.  **_Explain_** why these sections are important to the author’s argument.
    
4.  **_Give a practical example_** that can help us understand the argument.
    

We'll discuss this in the main room.
