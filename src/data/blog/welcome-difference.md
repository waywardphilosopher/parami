## Welcome

Welcome to Dealing with Difference, your second-year Parami seminar class. It's great to have you on board.

This is a seminar course. What this means is that we'll be reading a wide range of very different texts, sharing our own experiences and ideas. This course is *reading and writing intensive*. This means that there is a lot of reading, and also we'll be working on a lot of writing as we grapple with new ideas and perspectives. Some of the readings may feel more straightforward than others, and for some, we may need to re-read several times to make sense of what is happening. But to get the most out of this course, you need to get into a habit of reading!

## About this site 
I'm just setting up the website at the moment. But this will be the place for ongoing course notes from the classes. For every class, I will upload my own class notes for you to read. This will be useful for you to catch up if you miss a class (we'll talk about attendance in our first class). I'll also upload any extra links and snippets that may be interesting and fun. So this website is a living document!

I've designed the website to be very, very lightweight. This means that it uses a minimal amount of data, and so whatever your device, it should load easily and efficiently. 

What isn't on this site:

- Cool interactive features
- Fancy graphics and animations
- Videos (though I may share links)
- Things you have to log in to access

What is on this site:

- Lots of words! It's text all the way!
- Useful information.
- My class notes, updated after every class
- Interesting ideas.
- Links to interesting places.
- Nice formatting, to make it easy to read.
