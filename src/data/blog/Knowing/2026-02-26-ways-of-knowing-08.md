## **Today's Reading**

Today we're moving on to the _Zhuangzi_ to explore a different set of approaches to knowledge. Today's reading is in four parts.

*   The opening paragraph about the pursuit of knowledge.
    
*   The story of Cook Ding cutting up the ox.
    
*   The story of Gongwen Xuan and the Commander of the Right
    
*   The story of Lao Dan's death, and Qin Shi's visit to mourn him.
    

## **Discussion**

To start with, we're going to have a chance to talk about the text. We're going to start with the following questions:

*   How is this text different from Plato's _Theaetetus_?
    
*   What is your experience of this text? Is it enjoyable? Frustrating? Intriguing?
    

## **Writing exercise**

In the Zhuangzi, it says, “Your life has a limit, but knowledge has none. If you use what is limited to pursue what has no limit, you will be in danger. If you understand this and still strive for knowledge, you will be in danger for certain!”

Write in response to this claim for 6/7 minutes. Then we'll bracket and share.

## **Cook Ding**

We're going to look in more detail at the passage on Cook Ding. First, we'll share a reading of it, popcorn-style. We'll start from the beginning of the chapter, and read on to “I have heard the words of Cook Ding and learned how to care for life!”

## **Questions on Cook Ding**

*   How did Cook Ding acquire his skill in cutting up oxen?
    
*   Does this reflect your own experience of acquiring skills?
    
*   What do you think Cook Ding means when he says, “I go at it by spirit and don’t look with my eyes. Perception and understanding have come to a stop, and spirit moves where it wants”?
    

NaN. Cook Ding doesn't always work fast and intuitively. He also works slowly and carefully, as in the passage: “However, whenever I come to a complicated place, I size up the difficulties, tell myself to watch out and be careful, keep my eyes on what I’m doing, work very slowly...” What do you think Zhuangzi is saying here?

NaN. In what sense can Cook Ding be said to “care for life”?

NaN. In what sense is Cook Ding's skill a kind of _knowledge_?

## **Homework**

For your homework, we're going to read the second section from Zhuangzi, this time with the famous butterfly dream. It's reading 6 on Canvas! It's a slightly longer reading than last time, but it's full of rich, interesting material.

*   This paper by Eric Schwitzgebel questions the traditional reading of Zhuangzi as being a writer who writes in praise of skill. It's well worth reading: [https://philarchive.org/archive/SCHTUZ-2](https://philarchive.org/archive/SCHTUZ-2)
