# About
This little website is designed to support students’ learning throughout the courses that I run at Parami University. Every session, there will be notes uploaded about the things we have explored in class. Meanwhile, there may (or may not… who knows?) be occasional extra snippets and updates.

The materials on this site are organised by course. For some courses, I teach more than one class, so for the sake of keeping things tidy, I’ll keep my notes for different classes in the same course bundled together in the same documents.

If you are a Parami student registered for one of my classes, I look forward to working with you all. If not, feel free to have a look around! But remember, this is a set of living documents, and a work in progress.

Remember: **please do not cite this site**! This is a support site for teaching, rather than a peer-reviewed academic resource.

## About Me

I'm Dr. Will Buckingham. I’m originally from the UK, but currently living in Taiwan. My background is in Fine Art (my undergraduate degree), anthropology (my master's degree) and philosophy (my PhD). But I’ve also taught creative writing for about twenty years, in universities, schools, hospitals, community settings, refugee camps… in fact, in all kinds of places.

Have a look at my [website](https://www.willbuckingham.com). 

I’ve been involved in Parami since around 2016—so getting on for ten years. When not teaching at Parami, I spend my days writing (my last book was called HELLO, STRANGER: STORIES OF CONNECTION IN A DIVIDED WORLD, and was published in paperback by Granta in 2022). 

I publish books, and run writing-related projects through my social enterprise [Wind&Bones](https://books.windandbones.com). Our latest book is a collection of stories translated between Taiwanese and Scottish Gaelic. It's [pretty cool](https://taigael.com). I'm also busy trying to upgrade my Mandarin Chinese, and my Taiwanese language. I also run public events in philosophy and creative writing in both English and Mandarin.

I was at Parami University at the very start, before it was a University, and worked in Myanmar on Parami’s founding faculty back in 2017, as well as in 2018-19 as a writer in residence along with my Wind&Bones compadre, Dr. Hannah Stevens.

That’s probably enough for an introduction. I look forward to meeting you all!

About this website: this site uses Astro, and a very fine theme that is developed in party by a burmese developer! So that’s quite cool.
